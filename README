Notepad++ Community Release TinyXml library
-------------------------------------------

The TinyXml parser library originally written by Lee Thomason and
available from http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/ or Sourceforge has been
modified over time to fit the changing needs of Notepad++.

Now these modifications, through the power of git, have been extracted from
Notepad++ into a stand-alone project once again and are being made available
for use to Notepad++ Plugin Developers both from within the nppcr_sdk and as
a stand alone project in its' own repository.
